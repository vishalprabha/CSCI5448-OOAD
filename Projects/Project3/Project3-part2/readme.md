# Assumptions and implementations

Changes to store:

1. Inorder to not place order for any new clothing items, a check is done at the DoInventory class(operation).
2. If an item being sold by a customer belongs to the clothing class, a tabulation is done using countClothing function and if clothing items are found to be zero, the clothing item being sold is not bought.
3.  The number of random buying customers were generated using a poisson distribution with help from logic present on stack overflow. Implement as a function in the OuterUtils class.

Changes to Clerks:

1. A new clerk object was created when musicStore class was instantiated, with a unique damage percentage of 10
2. After a clerk is chosen, logic has been built such that, there is a 10% change they fall sick. Itâ€™s assumed that only one clerk can fall sick and they will be replaced by another clerk if they are sick along with an announcement.

General changes made:
1. Variable names made more verbose (understandable)
